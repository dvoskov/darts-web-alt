<p>Next DARTS workshop will be held at TU Delft on 18 June 2019. In this workshop, we teach you how to perform a simulation of various industrial applications in open-source Delft Advanced Research Terra Simulator (DARTS). The primary focus and developed capabilities of DARTS are currently geothermal operations which include a multicomponent multiphase flow of mass and heat with chemical interactions. Advance multi-scale nonlinear formulation improves the run-time performance which makes DARTS a perfect choice for inverse modelling.</p>

<p> In our workshop, we will start with a short description of main reservoir simulation concepts and Operator-Based Linearization approach which is the primary technique used in the DARTS framework. Next, the basic capabilities of the DARTS simulation framework will be described based on a simple 1D homogeneous geothermal model. Next, we will introduce a more realistic 2D heterogeneous model with advanced modelling and post-processing capabilities. We will extend basic geothermal physics using the chemical formulation with kinetic reactions. Next, you will learn how to model complex 3D heterogeneous models in DARTS. In addition to geothermal applications, two exercises are added: one related to the classic petroleum model based on black-oil physics and another related to simulation with chemical reactions.</p>

<p> To effectively participate in this workshop, you need to know the basics of reservoir simulation and Python programming language. Please bring your laptop with a pre-installed Python and DARTS (details will be shared a few days in advance). If you are interested to participate in the workshop, please contact <a href = "mailto:D.V.Voskov@tudelft.nl">Denis Voskov</a>.
