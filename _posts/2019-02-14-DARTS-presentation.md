<p>Yang Wang presented the first official research project performed in DARTS framework at 44th Stanford Geothermal Workshop. In our work, DARTS is used to run benchmark tests within realistic geological structures which were compared with the state-of-the-art simulation frameworks. We demonstrate that our simulator achieved a good match for both low- and high-enthalpy conditions with the maximum spatial difference in pressure and temperature below 2% in comparison to other simulators. At the same time, DARTS provide high performance and flexibility of the code due to OBL approach which makes it particularly useful for uncertainty quantification. We investigated the influence of different geological parameters to the thermal breakthrough time for both low- and high-enthalpy conditions and found that the system lifetime heavily relies on variation in properties. Afterward, we conducted a series of sensitivity analysis for production regimes and geological properties in realistic geothermal applications.
