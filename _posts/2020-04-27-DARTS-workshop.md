<p> The first online DARTS workshop was a great success. A nice blend of academia and industrial people from four different countries. With a powerful combination between Jupyter notebook, Zoom and WhatsApp, it is possible to learn in a few hours how to use DARTS and apply it to problems of practical interests. Based on this afford, we start six new research projects all around the world. Big acknowledgements to DARTS development team.</p>
