Mark Khait made presentation at SPE Reservoir Simulation Conference. He describes the integrated simulation framework DARTS built on top of Operator-Based Linearization technique and show its applicability to various challenging physical and chemical problems. The OBL approach not only significantly reduces the amount of property-related computations, but detaches physics and simulation kernels. The kernels are built and launched separately which helps to run simulation on hybrid platforms including the combination of CPU for physics parametrization and GPU for off-loaded run of simulation engine.
