<p> Check the first geothermal simulation fully offloaded onto a GPU device. A forecast for 100 years with 3.2 mln. grid blocks geological model is taking only 7 minutes! This is run on a regular workstation equipped with NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti graphics card. Now we can perform full uncertainty quantification on a high-resolution geological model with an open-source DARTS platform in a day. Gaming gives a hand to engineering! Thanks to TOTAL for sponsoring our research.</p>
