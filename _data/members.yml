  github: darts-web
  bio: Xiaocong is a Ph.D. candidate at TU Delft. He received his masterâ€™s degree in petroleum engineering from China University of Petroleum (Beijing) in 2017. His current research interest is to study the complex foam behavior in porous media during foam enhanced oil recovery (EOR) processes based on the data obtained from lab experiments or field observation. Foam then is injected to mitigate gravity override and improve gas sweep efficiency, which provides a possible strategy to develop robust and efficient CO2 EOR and storage technology.
